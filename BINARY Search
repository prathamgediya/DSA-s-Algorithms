BINARY :- ( a, x, x)

- a is an array.
- n indicates number of elements in an array.
- x indicates value (element) to be search.

    1. [ Initialize ] Low <- 0
                        high <- n -1
    2. [ Perform search ]
          Repeat While low <= high
                Repeat step 3 & 4
    3. mid = ( low + high )/2;
    4. if(num<a[mid]) 
            then high = mid - 1
        else
            if(num>a[mid])
                then low = mid + 1
            else if(num=a[mid])    
              -> Print element is found in the list and go to step 6.
   5. if(low>high)
        -> Print element is not found in the list and go to step 6.
   6. [ Finished ] & Exit
