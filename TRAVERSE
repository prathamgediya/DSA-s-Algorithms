* Access each element of the data structure and doing some processing over
the data.

TRAVERSE :- (a, LB, UB)

- a is an array
- LB is Lower limit of array
- UB is uper limit of array
  1. [Intialize] i = LB
  2. [perform traversal and increament counter]
        While(i<=UB)
            (1) Write a[i] or Read a[i]
            (2) i = i + 1 
  3. [Finished] & Exit
