Normal and Linear Search's Algorithms are sam-sam

SEARCH :- ( a, n, x) 

- A is an array.
- N indicates number of elements in array.
- x indicates value (Elements) to be sreach.

      1. [ Initialize counter ] Set i = 0
      2. Repeat Step 03 and 04 for i = 0 to i < n
      3. if a[i] = x, then jump to step 06
      4. [ Increase Counterv] set i = i + 1
      5. [ End of step 02 loop.]
      6. Print x Found at i + 1 Position and go to step 08
      7. Print x not found (if a[i] != x, after all the iteration of the above for loop.)
      8. Stop.
