* Sring converting character into upper and lower case

Algorithm : Upper_Case(s1, s2)

  Step 1: [ Initialization ]
          i = 0

  Step 2: [ To Convert lower to upper case ]
            While(s1[i] != '\0')
              (i)     if(s1[i]>='a' && s1[i]<='z')
                          s2[i] = s1 - 32
              (ii)    i = i + 1
              
  Step 3: [ Print the upper case string ]
            print("s2")
            
  Step 4: [ Finished ] & Exit
